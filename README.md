# TemperatureConversionCalculator
Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin, and Rankine.
This is homework assignment from National University (Advanced programming in Java).
This is a JavaFX application to convert a given temperature between Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin, and Rankine.
The assignment was very specific on alignment, sizing, margins, padding. etc..
The assignment had to look just the example the instructor provided and I did so with 100% accuracy.
All conditional statements and exceptions have been handled accordingly.
